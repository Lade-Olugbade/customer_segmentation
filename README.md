## Introduction

Customer segmentation is a crucial task in marketing and business strategy. By clustering customers based on their attributes or behaviors, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and increase profitability.

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis contains [describe your dataset briefly]. 

## Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed the dataset to understand its structure, distributions, and relationships between variables.
   - Identified key features and potential patterns within the data.

2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:
   - Reduced the dimensionality of the dataset using PCA.
   - Extracted the most significant components that explain the variance within the data.

3. **KMeans Clustering**:
   - Applied KMeans clustering algorithm to segment customers into distinct groups based on their attributes.
   - Determined the optimal number of clusters using techniques such as the elbow method or silhouette score.
